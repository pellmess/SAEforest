\value{
Four components are always included in an SAEforest object. \code{MSE_estimates} and \code{AdjustedSD} are
\code{NULL} except MSE results are requested. An element of \code{NrCovar} only exists for SAEforest objects
produced by \code{\link{SAEforest_meanAGG}}:

\item{\code{MERFmodel}}{The included \code{MERFmodel} object comprises information on the model fit, details
on the performed MERF algorithm as well as details on variance components. See below for an exact description
of components}
\item{\code{Indicators}}{a dataframe where the first column is the area-level identifier and additional columns
are the indicators of interest. Note that objects from \code{\link{SAEforest_meanAGG}} and \code{\link{SAEforest_mean}}
only report the "Mean".}
\item{\code{MSE_estimates}}{only if mse results requested. A dataframe where the first column is the area-level identifier and additional columns
are the MSE estimates for indicators of interest. Note that objects from \code{\link{SAEforest_meanAGG}} and \code{\link{SAEforest_mean}}
only report MSE values for the "Mean".}
\item{\code{NrCovar}}{only for objects of method \code{\link{SAEforest_meanAGG}}. A list comprising variable
names of covariates used for the calculation of needed calibration weights for point estimates. see vignette for
explanation}

Details on object of \code{MERFmodel}:

\item{\code{Forest}}{a random forest of type 'ranger' modelling fixed effects
of the model.}
\item{\code{EffectModel}}{a model of random effects of type 'lmer' capturing
tructural component of MERFs and modeling random components.}
\item{\code{RandomEffects}}{list element containing the values of random intercepts from \code{EffectModel}.}
\item{\code{RanEffSD}}{numeric value of the standard deviation of random intercepts.}
\item{\code{ErrorSD}}{numeric value of standard devition of unit-level errors.}
\item{\code{VarianceCovariance}}{VarCor matrix from \code{EffectModel}.}
\item{\code{LogLik}}{vector with numerical entries showing the loglikelihood of the MERF algorithm.}
\item{\code{IterationsUsed}}{numeric number of interatirons used until covergence of the MERF algorithm.}
\item{\code{OOBresiduals}}{vector of OOB-residuals.}
\item{\code{Random}}{character specifying the random intercept in the random effects model.}
\item{\code{ErrorTolerance}}{numerical value to monitor the MERF algorithm's convergence.}
\item{\code{initialRandomEffects}}{numeric value or vector of intial specification of random effects.}
\item{\code{MaxIterations}}{numeric value specifying the maximal amount of iterations for the
MERF algorithm.}

\description{
An object of class SAEforest always includes point estimates of regionally disaggregated economic
and inequality indicators and a \code{MERFmodel} object including information on the model fit for fixed
effects as well as random effects. Optionally an SAEforest object includes corresponding MSE estimates.
If the method used for estimation is \code{\link{SAEforest_meanAGG}}, the SAEforest object additionally
includes an element, capturing the number of variables used in the weighting process from aggregated
covariate information. For an object of class SAEforest, the following generic functions are applicable:
\code{\link{print}}, \code{\link{plot}}, \code{\link{summary}} and \code{\link{summarize_indicators}}.
Additional generic functions are applicable to the \code{MERFmodel} object. See Details for more information.
}
\details{
Among other elements, the included \code{MERFmodel} object contains a random forest of class 'ranger'
modelling fixed effects and a random effects model of class 'lmerMod'.  Thus, all generic functions
applicable to objects of classes 'ranger' and 'lmerMod' can be used on these elements. For details on
generic functions see \code{\link[ranger]{ranger}} and \code{\link[lme4]{lmer}} as well as the examples below.
